  During the 5 years of my PhD research I investigated the response of Salish Sea estuaries in British Columbia and Washington State to the stressors of exotic species through field-based analyses and theoretical models. This has led to my interest and current engagement in the development of adaptive management strategies in which 1) science is used directly by managers to revise, inform and assess decision-making and 2) managers and scientists co-develop applicable scientific research, motivated by outcomes and revised ecological and social value objectives.</p>
